### hi there, i'm julian :)

i'm just someone who loves to experiment with code, learn new things, and have fun while doing it. i'm currently working on python and c# projects, and learning to use git along the way.

---

### what i'm up to:
- learning the basics of **git**, **python**, and **c#**
- figuring out how to break (and fix) things in **basic coding**
- maybe soon: exploring **mysql** databases down the line

---

### tech i'm playing with:
- **languages:** python, c#
- **tools:** git, vscode, recently switched to the jetbrains suite
- **future:** mysql maybe

---

### about me:
i'm all about experimenting with code and having a good time while at it. i don't have a favorite language (yet) but i'm vibing with python and c#.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b36445e4-f068-430d-b429-41bbfd130b4a)### hi there, i'm julian :)

i'm someone who loves to experiment with code, learn new things, and have fun while doing it. i'm currently working on python and c# projects, and learning to use git along the way.

---

### what i'm up to:
- currently i'm busy with school, and the only time i can assign to coding is when i code for school, mostly in private repositories (like cs-RSA which i recently published)
- for school i'm mostly working on my matura-project, a big final project with a subject of own choice, where i'm in a rather theoretical field covering **cryptography** and **quantum-computing**
- gaining experience in core software development principles, such as **git**, **unit tests**, **ci/cd**, **clean code**
- as i do not have the time to learn a new language, like rust or c++ which i'd love to learn, i write all my projects in **python** or **c#**, making me more experienced in those languages

---

### tech i'm playing with:
- **languages:** python, c#
- **tools:** git, vscode, rider, github copilot, sonarqube
- **api's:** loads of llm apis, including **openai**, **google gemini** and various similar ones from **groq**, **together**...
- **future:** hopefully **c++** and/or **rust**

### personal relationship with tech
- i was interested in computer hardware very early, configuring and assembling my very first pc at 10 years old
- after having this pc, i started experimenting with linux very soon
- i really started my journey into linux after buying a raspberry pi to run a minecraft server using pterodactyl
- i was always curious and experimenting, for example triple-booting my dual-core locked-down school-laptop with windows/macos/linux
- like many i started my first few coding projects in python, building simple cli tools or games like snake
- nowadays i have a full homelab running proxmox with various linux lxc's and docker containers and a fully setup networking from local rerouting of traffic to hosting part's of my services on cloud platforms (hetzner, aws, oracle) or dedicated servers
- although i do not have a particular interest in it, gaining so much experience trying to understand software and sysadmin stuff, i gained some basic knowledge regarding cybersecurity in the internet, learning to leverage cloudflare and other tools to secure my private services
- even though i have little time, and there's not really any services i don't ahve yet, i still sometimes tinker with my homelab or my rack server i have lying under my bed
- my interest in tech across all domains isn't fading any time soon and currently i'm trying to collect experience in software development (no webdev/gui software)

### my interets, hobbies and time-wasting favorites
- whenever possible, i listen to music of various kinds, from crystal castles over tame impala to some random unkown band from the 80s
- i love buying new tech or helping other people with buying/setting up tech
- a lot of my time and effort goes into my school carreer
- reading, currently mostly manga, was always something i could spend a whole day on without a break
- watching anime, with my favorite being tokyo ghoul, helps me relax and disappear into my head after a long day
- if the weather is nice, i love going for walks to be alone with my thoughs
- spending time in a nice environment with nice people helps me get off my screen :)

feel free to check out my repos (though most repos might be private tbh) :D

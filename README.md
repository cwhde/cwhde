### hi there, i'm julian :)

i'm someone who loves to experiment with code, learn new things, and have fun while doing it. i'm currently working on python and c# projects, and learning to use git along the way.

---

### what i'm up to:
- currently i'm busy with school, and the only time i can assign to coding is when i code for school, mostly in private repositories (like cs-RSA which i recently published)
- for school i'm mostly working on my matura-project, a big final project with a subject of own choice, where i'm in a rather theoretical field covering **cryptography** and **quantum-computing**
- gaining experience in core software development principles, such as **git**, **unit tests**, **ci/cd**, **clean code**
- as i do not have the time to learn a new language, like rust or c++ which i'd love to learn, i write all my projects in **python** or **c#**, making me more experienced in those languages

---

### tech i'm playing with:
- **languages:** python, c#
- **tools:** git, vscode, rider, github copilot, sonarqube
- **api's:** loads of llm apis, including **openai**, **google gemini** and various similar ones from **groq**, **together**...
- **future:** hopefully **c++** and/or **rust**

feel free to check out my repos (though most repos might be private tbh) :D
